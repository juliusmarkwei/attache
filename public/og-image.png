# This should be a proper 1200x630 PNG file
# For now, we'll use a base64 encoded PNG that matches our SVG design
# In production, you would convert the SVG to PNG using a tool like:
# - Online SVG to PNG converter
# - Image editing software like Figma, Sketch, or Photoshop
# - Command line tools like ImageMagick or Inkscape

# The PNG should contain:
# - Background: #47333B to #876F53 gradient
# - Logo: Attache logo with document icon
# - Text: "Attache - Document Management Platform"
# - Features list: Gmail Integration, Automatic Processing, etc.
# - Brand colors: #FFB900 for accents
